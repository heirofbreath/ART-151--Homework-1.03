# ART-151--Homework-1.03

Homework Webpage for my Intro to Creative Coding class.
My teacher said to make a personal page about one of our favorite characters, so I thought it would be interesting to make an attempt at recreating an "FBI File" for Dallas from PAYDAY 2.

Mr. Moreno, if you are reading this:

Hopefully I did a decent enough job to not have to explain this, but just in case:
I did style the page to be reminiscent of the character's world. Because of the aforementioned "FBI Database", and the game's UI, the design is intentionally flat and digital.
I would have tried to replicate the scanline/semi-transparent image theme the actual game has, but in all honesty, that is photoshop work that is frankly out of my league. I hope you understand.
